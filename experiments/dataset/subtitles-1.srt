80.799 --> 85.28
you can see there's no closed caption

82.64 --> 87.36
subtitles on this at all so i click on

85.28 --> 88.96000000000001
the video i'm gonna pause it

87.36 --> 90.72
because i don't want it to play and i'm

88.96 --> 92.88
gonna click on edit

90.72 --> 94.72
and when we're in the edit screen

92.88 --> 97.67999999999999
just wait for this to come up i'm gonna

94.72 --> 99.36
click on subtitles and after about two

97.68 --> 101.52000000000001
hours of processing your video you're

99.36 --> 103.68
going to get two lots of subtitles on

101.52 --> 105.759
the screen one which is what your

103.68 --> 107.60000000000001
language is and one which has been auto

105.759 --> 110.07900000000001
generated to what your language is which

107.6 --> 111.83999999999999
is this one here it's this one here that

110.079 --> 114.079
i'm interested in and all you're going

111.84 --> 116.799
to do is click on the free

114.079 --> 119.36
dots at the end click download and

116.799 --> 121.759
download it as an srt file

119.36 --> 123.92
simples huh once you've done that you

121.759 --> 125.04
can actually delete

123.92 --> 128.479
that

125.04 --> 129.75900000000001
uh subtitle category and that's gone all

128.479 --> 131.36
we're going to do then is we're going to

129.759 --> 134.95899999999997
take the language that you're actually

131.36 --> 137.44000000000003
recording your video in and click add

134.959 --> 139.44
then we're going to be uploading file

137.44 --> 141.68
with timing and then we're just going to

139.44 --> 142.8
add the file that we just created which

141.68 --> 145.28
is here

142.8 --> 147.52
and as you can see it's put all of this

145.28 --> 148.959
into the youtube video in my language

147.52 --> 151.04000000000002
now i just want to change some of the

148.959 --> 154.16
things it can never get world of wayne

151.04 --> 156.07999999999998
right so i have to change that manually

154.16 --> 158.04
to world of wayne and you can scroll

156.08 --> 160.239
down this and just check you can add

158.04 --> 162.16
capitalization to words

160.239 --> 163.84
just check all your subtitles are

162.16 --> 166.07999999999998
correct now i'm not going to do that on

163.84 --> 168.31900000000002
this video but what i am going to do is

166.08 --> 169.20000000000002
pretend yep that's all done uh we should

168.319 --> 171.28
be good with that and all you're going

169.2 --> 173.35999999999999
to do is click publish

171.28 --> 175.28
and when you publish it as you can see

173.36 --> 177.519
we have now got english subtitles

175.28 --> 179.84
published all good we've got english

177.519 --> 182.72
subtitles on our video but now i want to

179.84 --> 184.64000000000001
add subtitles in other languages so to

182.72 --> 186.319
do that click on add language

184.64 --> 189.44
and i'm going to go through all the

186.319 --> 191.35999999999999
countries that i do so i do chinese

189.44 --> 193.35999999999999
uh i do check

191.36 --> 194.87900000000002
i do dutch

193.36 --> 196.239
uh i do

194.879 --> 197.76
french i mean you can pick whatever you

196.239 --> 199.20000000000002
want there's loads there's even klingon

197.76 --> 202.48
on here believe it or not i'll show you

199.2 --> 204.879
that in a second german i do greek

202.48 --> 206.72
um i do hindi

204.879 --> 208.319
uh

206.72 --> 210.959
i don't know who watch the videos in

208.319 --> 214.95899999999997
klingon i have to say look cling on

210.959 --> 216.56
i do latvian uh and then i go over to uh

214.959 --> 219.28
polish

216.56 --> 221.84
uh then i do portuguese

219.28 --> 224.159
uh where is that portuguese

221.84 --> 227.04
i do romanian

224.159 --> 229.519
this is just um uh like a cross section

227.04 --> 231.67999999999998
of my audience so uh obviously if you

229.519 --> 233.36
are in a different language then you you

231.68 --> 235.59900000000002
might have a um

233.36 --> 239.20000000000002
a different like uh selection here uh so

235.599 --> 241.28
romanian russian and then i do spanish

239.2 --> 243.04
i think that's a good a good cross

241.28 --> 245.599
section there and then this is the

243.04 --> 247.92
simple part if you want to add subtitles

245.599 --> 250.0
in chinese because i uploaded this to

247.92 --> 252.159
this file here english all i'm going to

250.0 --> 254.239
do is click add

252.159 --> 256.4
and auto translate and it auto

254.239 --> 259.28000000000003
translates and then publish

256.4 --> 261.12
into chinese do the same for check

259.28 --> 264.08
auto translate

261.12 --> 265.199
publish that's check done

264.08 --> 266.8
dutch

265.199 --> 269.04
auto translate

266.8 --> 270.96000000000004
publish

269.04 --> 273.199
see how easy this is and you just

270.96 --> 274.56
basically continue working down the list

273.199 --> 276.8
then that will give your viewers the

274.56 --> 279.199
option to watch your videos with closed

276.8 --> 281.199
captions in their language

279.199 --> 284.24
so

281.199 --> 286.72
this isn't 100 foolproof obviously the

284.24 --> 288.32
google translations which is using is

286.72 --> 290.40000000000003
not going to be perfect but it's better

288.32 --> 293.04
to have some understanding than no

290.4 --> 295.12
understanding at all but that is how you

293.04 --> 297.6
quite simply add subtitles from other

295.12 --> 299.6
language to all your videos now it takes

297.6 --> 302.0
about two hours i said to process your

299.6 --> 304.24
video to have those auto-generated

302.0 --> 305.84
subtitles on your channel uh sometimes

304.24 --> 307.36
it can take longer i've known it to take

305.84 --> 309.039
overnight to be honest with you but once

307.36 --> 311.28000000000003
they're on there you can actually use

309.039 --> 312.88
that file to upload to your own language

311.28 --> 315.59999999999997
and then convert it to whatever language

312.88 --> 317.68
you want even klingon i hope that's been

315.6 --> 319.199
a big help for you anyway and i really

317.68 --> 320.32
hope you enjoy uh some of the content

319.199 --> 321.84000000000003
