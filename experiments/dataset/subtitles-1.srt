I lost what made me cool yeah it's like

371.12 --> 375.12
being white is kind of yeah can you pull

372.72 --> 377.0
it's good in the blue collar Workforce

375.12 --> 379.0
but in the creative space oh it's out

377.0 --> 380.36
it's out God I wouldn't have chosen it

379.0 --> 382.24
if I knew it was going to be out yeah

380.36 --> 383.599
like when I date a white guy oh my god

382.24 --> 385.08
when I date a white guy I can't ever

383.599 --> 387.24
talk about it I can't ever show it

385.08 --> 389.71999999999997
because I know and we haven't we haven't

387.24 --> 392.039

389.72 --> 393.36
talk about it um I a dog guy I don't

392.039 --> 394.52
know if that throws a wrench in this

393.36 --> 396.0
whole thing but no it doesn't throw a

394.52 --> 397.56
wrench it just like do you keep your

396.0 --> 400.039
house doesn't smell like dog so it's

397.56 --> 402.12
okay well boy are you lucky we l a

400.039 --> 404.84
candle for Breeze the hell out of this

402.12 --> 407.28000000000003
house before you walked okay cool I do

404.84 --> 408.28
the same thing this is Robbie he's just

407.28 --> 410.71999999999997
he's just standing there and I didn't

408.28 --> 414.08
realize and it scared the hell out of me

410.72 --> 417.319
so what is your uh affinity for dressing

414.08 --> 419.75899999999996
up as bald men I met this French woman

417.319 --> 421.16
when I was like 15 love the French was

419.759 --> 424.56
talking about this before we started the

421.16 --> 426.52000000000004
podcast but um she was like the coolest

424.56 --> 429.039
thing you can do is not to rely on your

426.52 --> 430.28
sex appeal just to be weird she's like

429.039 --> 432.08
the what I do every year I you're

430.28 --> 433.96
telling me that's not raw sex appeal

432.08 --> 436.87899999999996
right there no it's not it's [ __ ]

433.96 --> 439.28
cool and so I do a bald one every year

436.879 --> 441.16
and then I do like a whole bunch of sexy

439.28 --> 443.35999999999996

441.16 --> 445.91900000000004
oh definitely yeah yeah when when did

443.36 --> 447.56
you know that you had sex appeal um not

445.919 --> 450.08

447.56 --> 451.4
predominantly white neighborhood so I

450.08 --> 452.71999999999997
didn't really know at all cuz all the

451.4 --> 455.919
girls were white and they were the ones

452.72 --> 459.199
getting all the men and then um is that

455.919 --> 461.75899999999996

601.32 --> 605.88
life my bed sheets haven't been changed

603.839 --> 608.32
for the past month like what am I doing

605.88 --> 611.959
right now jar you might need to go to

608.32 --> 613.9590000000001
psychosis I wash them you wash them how

611.959 --> 617.1199999999999
often do you change your pillowcase uh

613.959 --> 620.2399999999999
actually very often cuz I got I got silk

617.12 --> 621.8
pillowcases do the smell smell no smell

620.24 --> 624.399
I think you were just nose blind to your

621.8 --> 626.56
own stench as well I think if a man or

624.399 --> 628.16
woman were to enter your bedroom with

626.56 --> 631.3599999999999
the thoughts of arousal I think

628.16 --> 632.92
immediately a flacid anything would be

631.36 --> 635.32
present because of the smell and that's

632.92 --> 637.4799999999999
not me saying that that's God telling me

635.32 --> 640.0790000000001
a flacid anything a [ __ ] can't get

637.48 --> 642.5600000000001
flaccid are you gay no but he's thinking

640.079 --> 644.399
about starting really in June yeah I

642.56 --> 646.279
always ask my male friends like why

644.399 --> 648.2
don't you turn gay it's way more

646.279 --> 651.92
beneficial than being straight I think

648.2 --> 653.5600000000001
well in what way I just feel like

651.92 --> 655.04
there's a lot of gay people in power and

653.56 --> 657.04
like if you want some of that tea like

655.04 --> 660.48
get down can you name three gay people

657.04 --> 663.4399999999999
in power yes Billy Porter of course

660.48 --> 664.8000000000001
Ellen degenerous she had a fall from

663.44 --> 667.44
grace she had a little bit of loss of

664.8 --> 669.399
power recently all right Billy Porter

667.44 --> 672.48
one there's so many gay people Mark

678.48 --> 682.5600000000001

680.56 --> 684.8

682.56 --> 687.8

684.8 --> 690.04
an an extra SI no feel free oh is that

687.8 --> 692.16

717.0 --> 720.88
that okay you kind of give like you had

718.56 --> 723.3599999999999

720.88 --> 726.32
father yeah he was misog other women if

723.36 --> 729.16

in such a manner where it seems like I

765.88 --> 769.48
need to be monitored by a medical

767.48 --> 770.36
professional I think I would come in so

769.48 --> 772.88

770.36 --> 774.6
bit more Suave as the kids say okay so

929.959 --> 934.5999999999999
um actually we used to make not a lot at

932.24 --> 936.839
all but recently I think we've

934.6 --> 938.759
Diversified our portfolio in such a way

936.839 --> 940.36
that has gone up exponentially because

938.759 --> 942.8000000000001
you started have black people on this is

940.36 --> 945.24
our first time no it's not fita was on

987.6 --> 991.6
so far we we got to take a good picture

989.48 --> 993.72
together yes ma'am this episode is

991.6 --> 995.44
brought to you by better help can we be

993.72 --> 998.1600000000001
serious for a second there's so much

995.44 --> 1000.0
stigma when it comes to therapy of oh

998.16 --> 1002.279
you know I I don't know if I need it

1000.0 --> 1004.6
it's kind of scary to talk to somebody

1002.279 --> 1006.079
even if you're in a good place and most

1004.6 --> 1008.1990000000001
of us aren't

1006.079 --> 1010.68
including some people on this podcast

1008.199 --> 1013.68
mentally and when I say the therapy

1010.68 --> 1016.7199999999999
turns your life around in a way that

1013.68 --> 1019.16
working out does for your body it's

1016.72 --> 1021.0400000000001
incredible um just here's an instance I

1019.16 --> 1022.759
was in a very dark point in my life to

1021.04 --> 1024.3999999999999
get a little to get a little vulnerable

1022.759 --> 1027.88
I had know where to turn I tried talking

1024.4 --> 1030.799
to family and friends and just none of

1027.88 --> 1032.959
them had I guess the right answers and

1030.799 --> 1036.12
also they had different biases towards

1032.959 --> 1038.0
me so they tried to direct me in a way

1036.12 --> 1040.7199999999998
that they saw fit where therapist is

1038.0 --> 1042.439
just there to bounce off ideas with you

1040.72 --> 1045.039
what's going on your brain and they're a

1042.439 --> 1047.039
medical professional who can who can

1045.039 --> 1049.64
really dive in and give you the proper

1047.039 --> 1052.16
answers to make you feel right and okay

1049.64 --> 1054.48
and better help is the easiest and least

1052.16 --> 1057.0800000000002
scary way to make that jump because it's

1054.48 --> 1058.72
all online you don't have to go in and

1057.08 --> 1060.48
and you know go through traffic to go

1058.72 --> 1062.559
see someone you're in the comfort of

1060.48 --> 1063.44
your home you're in a safe space it's

1062.559 --> 1066.08
like

1063.44 --> 1068.799
FaceTiming even Beyond a friend it's

1066.08 --> 1071.0
it's FaceTiming someone who's there and

1068.799 --> 1073.6399999999999
really wants to help you if that makes

1071.0 --> 1075.2
sense and I know again therapy is very

1073.64 --> 1077.3200000000002
scary but what if you're ever going to

1075.2 --> 1079.64
try anything in life even if if you're

1077.32 --> 1081.72
in any type of rut I think better help

1079.64 --> 1083.64
and therapy is honestly the way to go

1081.72 --> 1085.679

2675.96 --> 2680.48
y'all go posting them but um it was in

2678.52 --> 2682.24
Ashlin Oregon which is where a whole

2680.48 --> 2684.52
bunch of hippies are and like a lot of

2682.24 --> 2686.9599999999996
communes and it was actually on a

2684.52 --> 2689.599
commune and there was like um a Darkness

2686.96 --> 2692.0
Retreat a sauna and this thing called a

2689.599 --> 2694.6800000000003
Kea what is that I'll tell you about it

2692.0 --> 2696.839
all so a Darkness Retreat is they get

2694.68 --> 2699.3999999999996
they get a room it's like a big cabin

2696.839 --> 2702.92
and they block out any way light could

2699.4 --> 2705.559
come in and there's a sink a bathtub a

2702.92 --> 2707.04
bed a yoga mat and a hole in the wall

2705.559 --> 2709.96
that's like double-sided for them to

2707.04 --> 2712.359
give you your food and you sit there and

2709.96 --> 2714.28
you sit there for as long as you can

2712.359 --> 2715.68
before you would just like go crazy well

2714.28 --> 2716.76
you have to do therapy before cuz you

2715.68 --> 2718.1189999999997
would go crazy if you didn't do the

2716.76 --> 2720.3590000000004
therapy before how long were you in

2718.119 --> 2722.319

2720.359 --> 2723.4
complete darkness yeah I didn't know

2722.319 --> 2725.0

2723.4 --> 2726.64
me my food they gave me meal prep for

2725.0 --> 2727.92
the entire day at night you know you can

2726.64 --> 2729.5989999999997

a lot from restroom yeah there was a

2735.559 --> 2739.3590000000004

2831.48 --> 2834.359
like Gods we had Jake Weber on the

2833.4 --> 2837.2400000000002

2837.24 --> 2842.9599999999996
yeah he likes it did you like be like

2839.28 --> 2844.6800000000003
twin was talking me and my twin in them

2842.96 --> 2846.8
yeah feel that when you're talking I did

2844.68 --> 2848.1189999999997

2846.8 --> 2850.119
felt like if all almost lived his life

2848.119 --> 2852.839

so much yeah what about you do you have

2854.48 --> 2858.599

2856.28 --> 2861.079
bit of depression oh no actually I don't

2858.599 --> 2863.2000000000003
have depression okay lied narcissism

2861.079 --> 2865.0
narcissism where did the narcissism come

2863.2 --> 2866.5989999999997
from because you said you didn't feel

2865.0 --> 2867.72
valued a little bit when you were where

2866.599 --> 2869.8
I think that's where it came from but

2867.72 --> 2873.319
now it's like now that you know for like

2869.8 --> 2875.48
a better term that you're that girl um

2873.319 --> 2879.599
oh follow-up question am I baby a girl

2875.48 --> 2883.2400000000002
no okay uh followup back to you when did

2879.599 --> 2885.319
the narcissism develop into what it is

2894.839 --> 2899.92

2896.92 --> 2903.559
question when did you become self-aware

2899.92 --> 2905.839
of your narcissism um I think probably

2903.559 --> 2907.88
all my relationships failing I can't

2905.839 --> 2913.88
more and more aware of it every time can

2907.88 --> 2916.48
you explain what some examples yeah um

2913.88 --> 2918.1600000000003

2916.48 --> 2920.0
crazy person and that's what we love

2918.16 --> 2922.1189999999997

2929.92 --> 2934.319
with myself and alone so like you really

2932.2 --> 2936.48
have to be the [ __ ] for me to want to

2934.319 --> 2938.7599999999998
stay in a relationship with you and I

2936.48 --> 2940.52
realized like are there okay before

2938.76 --> 2943.96
you're going to move on obviously but

2940.52 --> 2947.48
what are some examples of them being the

2943.96 --> 2949.48
Kaka [ __ ] yeah I Tred my mom watch yeah

2947.48 --> 2951.72
yeah yeah yeah um like a man being a

2949.48 --> 2957.079
[ __ ] being like emotionally

4368.6 --> 4373.76
movement I don't got to watch

4376.639 --> 4381.679
might have done it I haven't done it

4378.76 --> 4383.719

4381.679 --> 4385.4800000000005
someone like I've I've dated people

4383.719 --> 4387.4

4401.679 --> 4406.2390000000005
but I'm sure they' probably would bring

4404.199 --> 4408.12
it up at some point if it lasted longer

4406.239 --> 4410.0
when yeah that was my next question

4408.12 --> 4412.639
what's your longest relationship uh only

4410.0 --> 4415.52
like a year and a half was it recent no

4412.639 --> 4418.8
what about yours hm when was your last

4415.52 --> 4420.040000000001
longterm relationship next question what

4418.8 --> 4421.6
were their name you want to talk to them

4420.04 --> 4422.12
straight to camera also they're here

4421.6 --> 4423.320000000001
come

4422.12 --> 4426.84
[Music]

4423.32 --> 4429.92
in I would throw up hi was it your fault

4426.84 --> 4431.32
or their fault it's always my fault oh I

4429.92 --> 4433.36
think it's my fault because I ask too

4431.32 --> 4434.5599999999995
much of a person I don't even ask too

4433.36 --> 4436.639
too much of a person but I think it

4434.56 --> 4438.2390000000005
seems like I asked too much of a person

4436.639 --> 4440.36
probably means you're asking too much of

4438.239 --> 4442.199
I really don't I really really don't all

4440.36 --> 4445.88
my relationships has been like you're in

4442.199 --> 4450.12
a different state let's not date anymore

4445.88 --> 4454.08
or it's been like I'm 18 and I wasn't

4450.12 --> 4455.4
hot in high school let's go explore or

4454.08 --> 4457.639
like [ __ ] like that like I don't feel

4455.4 --> 4459.4
like I'm asking for a lot you just want

4457.639 --> 4461.0
to be in the same state and to explore

4459.4 --> 4464.679
you want to be in the same state and go

4461.0 --> 4467.4
outside yeah that again bar pretty low

4464.679 --> 4468.88
bar is my bar is pretty low it's pretty

4467.4 --> 4471.719
low but now it's getting higher and

4468.88 --> 4474.28
higher with every relationship next only

4471.719 --> 4476.08
message only messages you or hangs out

4474.28 --> 4478.159
with you when they have time yeah that

4476.08 --> 4479.88
that's red flag they don't make time

4478.159 --> 4482.08
